# Windows-Terminal-Settings
This repository contains the code for the JSON file I use for the Windows Terminal application (which you can download from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701)). 

This will include terminals for:
- Windows PowerShell
- Command Prompt
- Azure Cloud Shell
- Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022
- Developer PowerShell for VS 2022
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Git Bash
- MINGW64 / MSYS2
- MSYS / MSYS2

(The working directories for Git Bash and MSYS2 will be starting at **`C:\Users\Pro`**)

Feel free to configure these settings to your preference.
